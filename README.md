Skin Lesion Analyser. CNN approach for the detection of skin lesions such as melanoma.

Model building and EDA of the data are available on the Jupyter Notebook file.

Main script file consists of a simple GUI for the project that helps the user to upload the image desired for analysis and retrieve the result. Mention the model is really simple with a low accuracy given this was build as a small school project.
